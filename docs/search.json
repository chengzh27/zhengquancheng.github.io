In biomedical research, AI algorithms can be used to reach diagnosis, predict disease progression and patients‚Äô survival, recommend patients‚Äô treatments and much more, which is all fascinating. But the question is: will these algorithms be ever applied in clinical practice and, in turn, improve people lives?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPsychobiology: looking at the bigger picture\n\n2020-11\nThe aim of the talk was to describe the potential of interdisciplinary research that crosses the boundaries of social and biological sciences, with a special focus on the field of psychobiology"
